## Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning to predict adverse drug events (ADEs) resulting from drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Using the comprehensive **TwoSIDES** database from the Tatonetti Lab, we develop Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to identify potential harmful interactions between pharmaceutical compounds.

### Clinical Impact
- **195,000+ deaths annually** in the US due to adverse drug interactions
- **30% of elderly patients** take 5+ medications simultaneously
- **Early DDI detection** can prevent hospitalizations and improve patient safety

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

**Polypharmacy**, the concurrent use of multiple medications, has become increasingly prevalent in modern healthcare. However, the exponential growth in possible drug combinations has created a critical safety gap:

#### Current Situation
- **Over 3,300 FDA-approved drugs** are available in the market
- This creates **5+ million possible drug pair combinations**
- Only **~63,000 combinations** have documented interactions in databases
- **Less than 2% of possible interactions** have been clinically studied

#### The Core Problem
**How can we predict adverse drug events for untested drug combinations before patients are harmed?**

### Why This Matters

#### 1. **Patient Safety Crisis**
- Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are the **4th leading cause of death** in the United States
- **~2 million serious ADRs** occur annually in hospitalized patients
- **Drug-drug interactions account for 20-30%** of all ADRs
- Preventable ADEs cost the US healthcare system **$30+ billion annually**

#### 2. **Clinical Trial Limitations**
- **Ethical constraints**: Cannot test all combinations on humans
- **Time-intensive**: Clinical trials take 10-15 years per drug
- **Expensive**: Average cost of $2.6 billion per new drug approval
- **Combinatorial explosion**: Testing all pairs is computationally infeasible
- **Underrepresented populations**: Most trials exclude children, pregnant women, and elderly

#### 3. **Knowledge Gap**
- Most DDI discoveries occur **after market approval** through adverse event reporting
- Physicians often prescribe drug combinations with **unknown interaction profiles**
- Electronic health record (EHR) alerts have **70-90% false positive rates**, leading to alert fatigue
- **Novel drug combinations** emerge constantly as new medications are approved

#### 4. **Vulnerable Populations**
- **Elderly patients** (65+) take an average of 7-8 medications daily
- **Cancer patients** often require 10+ concurrent medications
- **Patients with chronic diseases** (diabetes, hypertension, mental health) face highest risk
- **Women metabolize drugs differently** but are underrepresented in trials

### Research Questions

This project addresses the following critical questions:

1. **Prediction**: Can we accurately predict which drug pairs will cause adverse events before clinical exposure?

2. **Mechanism Understanding**: Which molecular features and biological pathways drive drug-drug interactions?

3. **Severity Assessment**: Can we distinguish between minor interactions and life-threatening ones?

4. **Generalization**: Will models trained on known interactions accurately predict interactions for newly approved drugs?

5. **Clinical Utility**: Can AI predictions reduce unnecessary prescriptions and improve patient outcomes?

### Success Criteria

A successful solution must:

✅ **Achieve >85% AUROC** in predicting known drug-drug interactions  
✅ **Generalize to unseen drugs** not present in training data  
✅ **Identify specific ADE types** (not just binary interaction/no-interaction)  
✅ **Provide interpretable predictions** that clinicians can trust and validate  
✅ **Scale efficiently** to evaluate millions of drug combinations  
✅ **Prioritize high-risk interactions** to focus clinical review efforts  

### Proposed Solution

We propose a **Graph Neural Network-based approach** that:

1. **Represents drugs as nodes** in a molecular interaction graph
2. **Encodes rich drug features**: molecular structure, known side effects, protein targets, pharmacological properties
3. **Learns interaction patterns** from the 63,000+ documented combinations in TwoSIDES
4. **Predicts ADEs for novel combinations** through learned graph representations
5. **Provides attention-based explanations** highlighting which molecular features contribute to predictions

By leveraging deep learning on comprehensive pharmacovigilance data, we aim to create a predictive tool that enhances medication safety and reduces preventable adverse drug events.


## Dataset

### TwoSIDES Database
- **Source**: [nSIDES.io](https://nsides.io/) - Tatonetti Lab
- **Scale**: 3,300+ drugs, 63,000+ drug combinations
- **Coverage**: Millions of potential adverse reactions mined from FDA reports
- **Type**: Drug-drug-effect relationships with statistical significance scores

### Complementary Datasets
- **OffSIDES**: Individual drug side effects (used as node features)
- **DrugBank**: Drug properties, molecular structures, protein targets
- **PubChem**: SMILES strings and molecular fingerprints


## 🏗️ Methodology & Architecture

### Modeling Approach: Progressive Complexity

### **Phase 1: Classical Machine Learning Baselines**

#### Feature Engineering
```python
For each drug pair (Drug A, Drug B):
- Molecular fingerprints (Morgan, MACCS)
- Physicochemical properties (MW, LogP, TPSA)
- Drug similarity scores (Tanimoto coefficient)
- Individual side effect profiles from OffSIDES
- Protein target overlap
- ATC classification codes
- Concatenated features: [Drug_A_features, Drug_B_features, Interaction_features]
```

#### Models to Implement

**1. Logistic Regression**
- Fast baseline
- Feature importance interpretability
- Good for understanding linear relationships

**2. Random Forest**
- Handles non-linear relationships
- Built-in feature importance
- Robust to overfitting
- **Expected Performance**: 75-80% AUROC

**3. XGBoost / LightGBM** ⭐ Often the best classical approach
- State-of-the-art gradient boosting
- Handles class imbalance well
- Fast training and inference
- **Expected Performance**: 80-85% AUROC
- **This often matches or beats simple neural networks!**

**4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- Good for high-dimensional data
- Kernel tricks for non-linearity
- Memory-intensive for large datasets

### **Phase 2: Simple Neural Networks**

#### Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
```python
Input Layer (concatenated features)
    ↓
Dense(512) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Dense(256) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Dense(128) + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
    ↓
Output Layer (sigmoid/softmax)
```

- Bridge between classical ML and deep learning
- Tests if neural networks add value
- **Expected Performance**: 82-86% AUROC

### **Phase 3: Advanced Deep Learning** (Only if baselines plateau)

#### **3A. Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**
```
Drug A + Drug B → GNN Encoder → Interaction Predictor → ADE Type + Severity
```
- **Node Features**: Molecular fingerprints, side effect profiles, targets
- **Edge Features**: Known interactions, co-prescription frequency
- **Architectures**: 
  - GraphSAGE (good for large graphs)
  - Graph Attention Networks (GAT) - adds interpretability
  - Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
- **Expected Performance**: 87-91% AUROC
- **When to use**: If you want to model the entire drug interaction network

#### **3B. Transformer-Based Models** (Advanced)
- SMILES-based encoding using ChemBERT/MolBERT
- Multi-head attention for drug pair interactions
- Pre-trained on chemical literature
- **Expected Performance**: 85-89% AUROC
- **Trade-off**: High computational cost

#### **3C. Ensemble Approach** (Optional)
- Combines predictions from multiple models
- Weighted voting or stacking
- Often gives 1-3% boost but adds complexity
