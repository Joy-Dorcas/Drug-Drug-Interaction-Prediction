# Drug-Drug-Interaction-Prediction
This project leverages deep learning to predict adverse drug events (ADEs) resulting from drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Using the comprehensive TwoSIDES database from the Tatonetti Lab, we develop Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to identify potential harmful interactions between pharmaceutical compounds.
